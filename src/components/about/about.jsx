                    <p1> Hey again, thanks for scrolling so far!! ðŸ¤— As a Computer Science & Business Administration student, I love exploring the intersection between technology, design, and business. When I'm not juggling schoolwork and extra-currciulars, you can find me competiting in case studies or hackathons <handwritten> (Hack the North '21 and '22!)</handwritten></p1>

                    <br></br>
                    <p1> Outside of coding, I am also an avid reader and writer, and have had some of my short stories published in magazines/anthologies. I also spend a lot of my time playing video games such as League of Legends, Minecraft, and TFT <handwritten> (add me!! ign: spaceturtlee)</handwritten>. During the summer, I also love to play sports like tennis <handwritten> (horribly)</handwritten>, and go camping with my family. </p1>
